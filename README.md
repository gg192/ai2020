This project contains the source code for the project, "main.py", as well as the text files used for the dataset. The purpose of this project was to determine words that were more frequently used within the genres. This was determined through words pulled from movie plot descriptions. NLTK was largely used for the classification portion of the project. Tutorials were followed from chapter 6 of NLTK's book.
